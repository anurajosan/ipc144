1. A) In the first the output was a = 4 and in second the output was a = 3.
   B) There is a difference of one because of the increment in the first example "a++" is been done after the printf so its adding and then showing the output and in the second one "a++" is after the printf so its showing and then adding the number.

2.when we use float price1= 10.11f ,the number is stored with less precision than double 

3. 

i) In this an integer is divide by an integer, and this will remove all the values after the decimal point. Due to the format specifier '%lf', the result which is supposed to be an integer is implicitly coerced to a double.

ii) In this example, an integer is divided by an integer and the format specifier is correctly matched with the data type. 

iii) In this example, again an integer is being divided by an integer, but if we look closely the variable money is being explicitly casted to a double. This casting leads the result to be a double, which is correctly matched with the format specifier '%lf'.

iv) In this example, again the money variable is being explicitly casted to a double. But the mismatched format specifier while printing causes the value to be lost.
